                        <h3>1.1 What are personal data</h3>
                        <p>
                            Personal data is information that reveals or can reveal the identity of the user. We adhere to the principle of data avoidance. Therefore, as far as possible, we refrain from collecting personal data.
                        </p>

                        <h3>1.2 Handling of personal data</h3>
                        <p>
                            Personal data is used exclusively to establish the contract, define its content, and implement or process the contractual relationship (Art. 6 (1 b) GDPR). Beyond that, personal data will only be processed if we have received your consent (Art. 6 (1a) GDPR) or if the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests and insofar the weighing of interests shows that there are no overriding interests, basic rights or fundamental freedoms on your part that conflict with this (Art. 6 (1f) GDPR).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We may use contract processors to process your personal data, but will not pass on your personal data to third parties. Only for the fulfillment of the contract, the data may be passed on to the shipping company commissioned with the delivery, insofar as this is necessary to deliver ordered goods. For the processing of payments, the payment data required will be passed on to the credit institution commissioned with the payment and, if applicable, to the commissioned and selected payment service provider. Your personal data will be processed exclusively within the EU unless otherwise stated below.
                        </p>

                            <li>the processing is unlawful and you refuse to delete it and instead request the restriction of use</li>
                            <li>we no longer need the data, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims,</li>
                            <li>you have objected to the processing of your data and it is not yet clear whether our legitimate reasons outweigh your reasons.</li>

                            You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that you have provided us within a structured, common and machine-readable format and you have the right to transfer this data to another person in charge without hindrance by us, provided that the processing is based on consent or a contract and that the processing is carried out by us using automated procedures.
                        </p>
